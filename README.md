First we choose a dataset in kaggle. then implement some feature like: Data Cleaning, exploratory data analysis through graphical representations, feature scaling, splitting data into training and testing sets, applying the Na√Øve Bayes Classifier, evaluating model performance through confusion matrix, train-test accuracy comparison, and
demonstrating the use of 10-fold cross-validation.
